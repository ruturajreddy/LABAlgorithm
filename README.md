## Abstract

- a new socio-inspired metaheuristic technique for engineering and global optimization problems
- inspired by the AI-based competitive behaviour exhibited by the individuals in a group while simultaneously improving themselves and establishing a role
  - Leader, Advocate and Believer
- validated using the CEC 2005 and CEC 2017 benchmark functions
  - statistical tests used : the Wilcoxon pairwise and two-sided test as well as the Friedman Rank Test
    - results compared with other algorithms such as FA, CI, GA, SA, PSO, Multi-CI, CMAES, ABC, SADE, CLPSO, BSA, IA, WOA, SHO, AVOA, LSHADE-Cn-EpsiN, FDB-SFS and LSHADE

- applied to solve engineering problems
  - abrasive water jet machining
  - electric discharge machining
  - micro-machining processes
    - outperformed SA, fbest and fbetter by achieving 76%, 85% and 75% minimization of Ra respectively for micro-milling with 0.7 mm tool diameter
    - achieved 81%, 72%, 85% minimization of Ra when compared to SA, $f_{best}$ and $f_{better}$ for 1 mm tool diameter
    - achieved 24% and 34% minimization of $B_h$ and $B_t$ as compared to SA for micro-drilling with a tool diameter 0.5 mm
    - for tool diameters 0.8 mm and 0.9 mm, 16% and 3% minimization of $B_t$, respectively, were achieved as compared to SA
  - turning of titanium alloy in a minimum quantity lubrication environment
- **results from this study highlighted that the LAB outperforms the other algorithms in terms of function evaluations and computational time**
